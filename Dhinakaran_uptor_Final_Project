**Project Title: Revenue Prediction and Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning**

**Objective:**
This project aims to analyze Netflix sales data and apply machine learning techniques to predict revenue and segment customer behavior using supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

**Dataset:**
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Month**: The time period of data collection.
- **Region**: Geographic location.
- **Subscribers**: Number of active users.
- **Revenue ($)**: Total revenue generated.
- **Ads Revenue ($)**: Revenue from advertisements.
- **Engagement (hrs)**: Total hours of user engagement.

**Supervised Learning - Revenue Prediction:**
- **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
- **Features Used**: Subscribers, Ads Revenue ($), Engagement (hrs)
- **Target Variable**: Revenue ($)
- **Process:**
  - The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
  - A Linear Regression model was trained on the training set.
  - The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
- **Results:**
  - **MSE:** 2,075,788,100,286.15
  - **R² Score:** 0.89 (indicating strong predictive performance)
- **Visualization:**
  - A scatter plot was generated to compare actual vs predicted revenue.

**Unsupervised Learning - Customer Segmentation:**
- **Algorithm Used**: K-Means Clustering
- **Features Used**: Subscribers, Revenue ($), Ads Revenue ($), Engagement (hrs)
- **Process:**
  - Data was standardized using the StandardScaler.
  - The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.
  - K-Means clustering was applied with k=3.
  - Cluster labels were assigned to each data point.
- **Results:**
  - The dataset was successfully segmented into 3 clusters based on sales trends.
- **Visualization:**
  - The Elbow Method plot was generated to determine the optimal number of clusters.
  - A scatter plot was created to visualize the clusters, using Subscribers and Revenue as axes.

**Conclusion:**
- Linear Regression effectively predicted revenue with a high R² score of 0.89.
- K-Means clustering helped group customers into meaningful segments for better marketing strategies.
- The insights gained from this project can help businesses optimize revenue and target customers more efficiently.

**Future Improvements:**
- Experiment with advanced regression models like Decision Trees or Random Forest.
- Use more features to improve revenue prediction accuracy.
- Apply other clustering techniques like DBSCAN for better segmentation.
