Project Report: Predicting Revenue & Clustering Sales Trends
1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze sales trends and predict revenue using a dataset containing information about Netflix subscribers, revenue, advertisements, and engagement. This project employs both Supervised Learning (Regression) to predict revenue and Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) to identify sales patterns.
2. Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key features:
•	Subscribers: Number of active users.
•	Ads Revenue ($): Revenue generated from advertisements.
•	Engagement (hrs): Total watch time of users.
•	Revenue ($) (Target Variable): Total revenue generated.
3. Methodology
3.1 Supervised Learning - Revenue Prediction
To predict revenue, a Linear Regression Model was used:
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	Missing values were handled by dropping incomplete rows.
o	Data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
o	Features were standardized using StandardScaler.
•	Model Training & Evaluation:
o	A Linear Regression model was trained on the dataset.
o	The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared Score (R²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
3.2 Unsupervised Learning - Clustering Sales Trends
To group sales trends, K-Means Clustering was applied:
•	Feature Scaling:
o	The dataset was standardized to ensure equal weightage to all features.
•	Finding Optimal Clusters:
o	The Elbow Method was used to determine the best number of clusters.
•	Applying K-Means:
o	The dataset was clustered into three groups (k=3) based on similarities in sales data.
•	Visualization:
o	Clusters were plotted to observe patterns in subscribers and revenue.
4. Results & Analysis
4.1 Revenue Prediction Results
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between actual and predicted revenue.
•	R-squared Score (R²): Measures how well the model explains the variance in revenue.
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Shows the average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
•	Findings:
o	A lower MSE and MAE indicate a well-performing model.
o	The R² score provides insights into how much variance in revenue is explained by the features.
4.2 Clustering Insights
•	Cluster Analysis:
o	Sales regions were grouped into three clusters based on revenue, subscribers, and engagement trends.
o	The clustering visualization helped identify high-revenue vs. low-revenue patterns.
5. Conclusion & Future Work
•	The Linear Regression Model successfully predicted revenue with reasonable accuracy.
•	K-Means Clustering identified meaningful patterns in sales trends.
•	Future Improvements:
o	Testing other regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for better accuracy.
o	Applying advanced clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
o	Adding more features, such as user demographics, for deeper analysis.
This project demonstrates the power of Data Science in revenue forecasting and business
decision-making. The insights from this study can help optimize marketing strategies and maximize profits for businesses like Netflix.
